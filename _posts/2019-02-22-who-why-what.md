### Who am I?

Hi, I am Kerem Yilmaz, a junior computer science student at Bilkent University, Turkey. You'll be able to learn more about me when I update the [About](/aboutme) page. 

### Why am I doing this?

When I just Google for a specific problem I'm facing or a topic I am curious about, sometimes I find what I need in someone's personal blog. After a while, I started thinking _"Why don't I have my own blog?"_.

After giving some thought on whether I can commit to this blog idea, I decided to start a blog not just because some people may benefit from it but also I can look back and see what I've accomplished in time. Also, I believe this will be a good opportunity to explain who am I and what I am capable in more detail compared to my CV.

Hence, here we are.

### What is this?


I haven't decided what the content will be yet, not concisely. I may explain problems I've encountered during my projects or using Linux and how I overcome those problems. I can also share my thoughts on interesting papers I've read, or maybe some introductory how-to tutorials, tips & tricks, etc. I will probably keep this blog completely technical, but time will tell.

Let's see how this goes.
